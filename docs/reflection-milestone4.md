# Milestone 4 reflection

Working with a large data set using Shiny dashboard has resulted in a longer than optimal load time both in the local environment and shinapps.io hosted environment. In general, this has decreased the usability of the dashboard as every time when the user wanted to update the parameters such as the date slider or the population density slider, it takes a while for the data to update and sometimes the dashboard would even crash when the slider has a values that are too wide.

In this milestone, we are asked to make improvements from the feedbacks of TA and peers.
